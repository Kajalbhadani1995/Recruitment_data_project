# Recruitment_data_project

## Introduction

This analysis aims to solve the recruitment problem of a company. The hiring team is getting an increasing number of applications for multiple job roles, that’s why the team is lacking clarity on applicant trends and hiring outcomes. They are trying to find a systematic way to store the data and to know about the offered and rejected applicants’ average age, gender analysis.To create this project, I have used two tools: Python and MySQL. I have connected the Python to MySQL using PyMySQL connector. I imported the data cleaned and transformed the data in Python and used MySQL to find the insights
also I created a presentation to present the findings clearly.

## Business Problem 

The company is receiving a high volume of job applications across different roles, but there is limited visibility into applicant trends and hiring patterns. The recruitment team does not have a structured way to monitor total applications, acceptance rates, or variations in candidate profiles such as age, gender, experience, and education level. Without these insights, it becomes difficult to evaluate whether the talent pool aligns with hiring requirements. 

The objective is to transform raw recruitment records into actionable insights that can support improved hiring strategies, workforce planning, and more data-driven decision-making within the recruitment process.

Q1. which top 5 job titles or roles received most applications? 

Q2. which month we have got the most applications? 

Q3. On which metrix we have accepted or rejected The candidates, education And experience wise? 

Q4. how many applicants are entry level, mid level and senior level? 

Q5. Which gender submitted more applications, and which gender received more offers?
